# Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Project 1:
## Movie Trailer Website

This is a basic website for helping students of Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer
Nanodegree explore classes and how to serve information onto the internet.

We are provided with the file "fresh_tomatoes.py" which will serve our self
written python code for movie classes onto the internet.

To see my list of favourite movies please do the following:
  1) Clone this repository locally
  2) Check to see if Python is installed with:
    -*python --version*, or;
    -*python3 --version*
  3) If it is not, please install it https://www.python.org
  4) Once this has been done, open your command line tool of choice and run
  *python/python3 entertainment_center.py*

This should open your favourite(default) web browser and run my page.

Thank you very much, any comments, queries or bugs, please report them to myself
at benrconway84@gmail.com
